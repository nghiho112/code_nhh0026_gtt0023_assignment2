Classical Guitar
The classical guitar is distinguished by having six strings, though some classical guitars have seven or more strings. All six strings are made from nylon, or nylon wrapped with metal, as opposed to the metal strings found on other acoustic guitars. The modern classical guitar (also known as the "Spanish guitar"), the immediate forerunner of today's guitars, was developed in the 19th century by Antonio de Torres Jurado, Ignacio Fleta, Hermann Hauser Sr., and Robert Bouchet.

Kora
The kora is built from gourd, cut in half and covered with cow skin to make a resonator with a long hardwood neck. The skin is supported by two handles that run underneath it. It has 21 strings, each of which plays a different note. These strings are supported by a notched, double free-standing bridge.[3] The kora doesn't fit into any one category of musical instrument, but rather several, and must be classified as a "double-bridge-harp-lute."

Banjo
The banjo is a stringed instrument with a thin membrane stretched over a frame or cavity to form a resonator. The membrane is typically circular, and usually made of plastic, or occasionally animal skin. Early forms of the instrument were fashioned by African Americans in the United States.[1][2] The banjo is frequently associated with folk, bluegrass and country music, and has also been used in some rock, pop and hip-hop.

Violin
The violin, sometimes known as a fiddle, is a wooden chordophone (string instrument) in the violin family. It is the smallest and thus highest-pitched instrument (soprano) in the family in regular use. Violins are most prominent in the Western classical tradition, both in ensembles (from chamber music to orchestras) and as solo instruments. Violins are also important in many varieties of folk music, including country music, bluegrass music, and in jazz.

Viola
The viola is a string instrument that is bowed, plucked, or played with varying techniques. Slightly larger than a violin, it has a lower and deeper sound. In the past, the viola varied in size and style, as did its names. The word viola originates from the Italian language. The Italians often used the term viola da braccio meaning literally: 'of the arm'.

Acoustic Guitar
An acoustic guitar is a musical instrument that produces sound through the vibration of its strings. It typically has a hollow body with a sound hole in the center that amplifies the sound produced by the strings. The body of an acoustic guitar is usually made of wood, and the top (or soundboard) is made of a thin piece of spruce or cedar, which is carefully selected for its tonal qualities. The strings of an acoustic guitar are made of steel or nylon and are attached to the bridge, which sits on the top of the guitar's body. The neck of the guitar is attached to the body and has frets, which are metal strips that divide the neck into different sections that correspond to different notes.

The instrument is played standing up, supported by a strap or harness over the shoulder.

Electric Guitar
An electric guitar is a stringed instrument that uses pickups to convert string vibration into electrical signals, which are then amplified through an amplifier and speaker. They have a solid or semi-hollow body, multiple pickups, tone and volume controls, and are played with a pick or fingers. Electric guitars are popular in rock, pop, blues, and jazz music due to their versatility and range of sounds.
3
Harp
The harp is a stringed musical instrument with a triangular frame and numerous strings that are plucked by the fingers. It has a resonating chamber that amplifies the sound produced by the strings.
